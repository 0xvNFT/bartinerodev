                <h3>How does bartering work?</h3>
                <p>It's simple. First, look for an item or service that you want. Second, make an offer for it. Third, wait for a response.</p>

                <h3>Is it free to join Bartinero?</h3>
                <p>Of course. Bartinero will not ask you to pay when signing up for an account.</p>

                <h3>What are the requirements to verify my account?</h3>
                <p>The user must be a citizen of Las Pinas City and should provide a valid ID that is not expired at the time of submission.</p>

                <h3>Why do I need to submit an ID?</h3>

                <p>No. Users are not allowed to participate in any kind of monetary transaction. Bartering doesn't require the use of real money.</p>

                <h3>How will I receive my bartered items?</h3>
                <p>Receiving of items will be entirely up to the agreement between the two parties in a trade. Currently, Bartinero does not support delivery options.</p>
